This is an Expo/React Native project with TypeScript.

- Use `bun` instead of `npm` and `bunx` instead of `npx`
- Use TailwindCSS (used as Nativewind) `className` prop for styling
- Use file-based routing with Expo Router. The root layout is [_layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/_layout.tsx)
- Screens are defined in `./src/app/**`
- Components are defined in `./src/components/**`
- Other TypeScript files like hooks, constants, config, etc. are in `./src/lib/**`
- Use Drizzle + Drizzle Kit for local DB. You can find the relavent files in `./drizzle/**` and `./src/lib/db/**`
